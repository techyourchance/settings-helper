# Settings Helper

Lightweight Android library that simplifies management of app's settings (i.e. shared preferences)

## Install

To use Settings Helper in your project, make sure that you have Maven Central set up in your root `build.gradle` script:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Then add SettingsHelper as a dependency into your main module's (called `app` by default) `build.gradle` script:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.techyourchance:settingshelper:1.0.0'
}
```
